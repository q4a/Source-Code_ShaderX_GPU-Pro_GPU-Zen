#  IMPORTANT NOTES: each line that starts with a '#' is a
#                   remark line and ignored by the parser
#                   each data line consists of two parts:
#                   *) the name of the property
#                   *) the value of the property
#
#                   some properties consist of more than one
#                   part (such as 'TerrainSize'). in such cases
#                   all parts have to be seperated by spaces only
#                   (no commas, no semicolons, etc...)

#  IMPORTANT: in order that the lens flare stays fixed at

#             on the cube! the cube goes from (-1000,-1000,-1000)
#             to (1000,1000,1000).
#             valid positions are e.g.:
#             (600,400,1000) or (-1000,300,900)
#             invalid positions:
