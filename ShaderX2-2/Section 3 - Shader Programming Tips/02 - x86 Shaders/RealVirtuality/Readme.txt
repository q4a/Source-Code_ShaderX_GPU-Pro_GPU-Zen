This software rendering demonstration is brought to you to illustrate
the use of the SoftWire Run-Time Assembler library.

Enjoy!

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
___________________

- Pentium III compatible processor (the demo makes use of the MMX and
  SSE instruction sets which are only featured on the Intel Pentium
  III and 4 and on the AMD Athlon XP and newer processors)
- Windows XP/2000 compatible operating system (the demo has been
  developed and tested only on these operating systems. Attempting
  to execute it on any other operating system might result in a
  failure)
- DirectDraw compatible graphics card capable of 640x480 resolution
  at 32-bit color depth

No 3D accelerator card required!

Should you meet these requirements, but the application fails, please
contact me.

TECHNOLOGY
__________

Transparantly to the user, the renderer chooses between different
qualities of filtering and prespective correction based on distance 
and polygon area. This is possible without compare or jump
instructions by using SoftWire's conditional compilation. By pressing
N you can switch texture border mode.
