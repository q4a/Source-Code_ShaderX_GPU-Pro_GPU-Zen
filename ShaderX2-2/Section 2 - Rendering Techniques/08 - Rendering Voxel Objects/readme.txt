Voxel Rendering with PS_3_0
---------------------------


The four movies found here are:

Holo_Brain.mpg
Holo_Bunny.mpg
Solid_Bunny.mpg
Solid_MetaBalls.mpg

The MR Brain and CT Bunny Volume data sets are obtained from the University of North Carolina. The format was changed to a DDS file, and the data "massaged" some (i.e. noise and unwanted data removed) to make it suitable for use.
---------------------------


This file:

D3DVoxel_SourceCode.zip

contains the source code. Note that the Debug version runs at a lower visual quality than the Release build.
