/**
 * @brief Managed memory manipulation.
 * @author Michal Valient
 * @version 1.0
 * 
 * Memory manager provides allocation / deallocation and reallocation of memory buffers,
 * routimes for creation / destroyment of objects.
 * In debug builds it validates freed pointers and reports memory leaks.
 * There is only one memory manager per application.
 * For object creation use new and delete operators
